## 📘 Overview  
The **Word Counter** is a beginner-friendly Go program that counts how many times each word appears in a sentence and shows the **total number of words**.  
It’s perfect for learning about **maps**, **loops**, and **string handling** in Go.

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. Takes a sentence input from the user.  
2. Converts the sentence to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.  
3. Splits it into words using `strings.Fields()`.  
4. Counts each word using a map.  
5. Prints each word’s frequency and the total number of words.
